DOF of a rigid body (2D):

Assume there's a coin. (page 13). 
To represent configuration choose 3 points on it. 
With a reference frame we will need 2 params for a point then : x,y
Take random points A, B, C
A = (xa, ya), B = (xb, yb), C = (xc, yc)

Now by the definition of a rigid body, the distances DA, DB, DC between these 2 points have to be constant.
DA, DB, DC are constraints.

D(A, B) = sqrt( sq(xa - xb) + sq(ya - yb) )
D(B, C) = sqrt( sq(xb - xc) + sq(yb - yc) )
D(A, C) = sqrt( sq(xc - xa) + sq(yc - ya) )

Constant-ness implies non-real values (DOF are real values) but its true that end points could vary (every B with an A for example)
Note that these fixed distances are constraints (constants are constraints). (Thus degrees of 'freedom' are params that attack constraints). 

Now if you fix A (xa, ya), then because D(A,B) is constant all possible values of B are on a circle with A as origin and DA as radius.
The best way then to refer to all (A, B) is (XA, YA, Theta) where Theta is the angle Vector (AB) makes with the X axis of the frame of reference. 
Thus 3 DOF to locate all A, B in a coin.

Now with A, B fixed, all C possible are really 2 values, i.e. C has to be on a point of intersection of the 2 circles AB and BC. 
Since DOF are real values (a 2 value is like a constant), therefore as I increase 1 point, DOF still remains 3 (X, Y, Theta).

If you add a D, it adds D(A, D), D(B, D) and D(C, D) as 3 additional constraints. Since C was fixed (2 values only) so D(C, D) is a redundant constraint.
(provides no new info). The 2 dof xd, yd introduced by the new point D are eliminated by the 2 constraints. Thus adding D (and additional points) does not increase DOF.

Therefore a rigid body (like a coin) in 2D space has 3 DOF (x, y, theta) to represent the configuration (complete specification of the position of every point of the body). If this coin was a single body link of a robit, its 2D DOF would be 3.

----

Something interesting came out of our observation from Point D's inclusion:

DOF = (sum of freedom of points) - (number of independent constraints)     [where independent = not-redundant, i.e. an actual/real constraint]

since constraints are expressed as equations (see above, because an equation is really a constraint of values. The rhs for example is a constraint in an equation that the lhs terms have to meet), and points are the number of variales (in a rigid body link for example), therefore:

DOF = (sum of freedoms of the bodies) - (number of independent equations)
For robots (physical), sum of freedom are actually given by Joints.

DOF of a rigid body (3D): 

Now the coin is not on a table, its in space.

So the reference frame has 3 axis.
Thus A = (xa, ya, za) etc.

Point B is on a the surface of a sphere with A as center and radius D(A, B) = sqrt( sq(xa-xb) + sq(xb-xc) + sq(xc-xa)) etc.
DOFs here are x, y, z,  Theta1 and Theta2 (2 angles needed to specify point B on a sphere) (coming to roll, yaw etc)  (in a 2D concept).
(In a 3D concept you can call it lat and long, hence 2)

Point C is at the intersection of the 2 spheres which can be described by a circle, hence parameterized by a Theta.
Hence DOF = 6 (x, y, z, Theta1, Theta2, Theta3). Additional points get eliminated.

Example 2.3 (Figure 2.4) shows 2 robots : (a) A 4-bar linkage and (b) A slider-crank mechanism.

Let's calculate DOFs of the 2 bodies.

(a) Four-bar linkage: N=4 (incl earth), J=4 (revolute joints all, so each Fi=1), m=3 (planar robot)

DOF = m(N-1-J) + sigma(Fi) = 3(4 - 1 - 4) + 4 = -3 + 4 = 1
# DOF = m(N-1-J) + sigma(Fi) = 6(4 - 1 - 4) + 4 = -6 + 4 = -2 (for spacial?)

(b) Slider-crank: N=3 (incl earth), J=3 (2 revolute, but 1 is RP (revolute & prismatic), F1 = 1, F2 = 1, F3 = 1+1(2)), m=3 (planar):
DOF = 3(3 - 1 - 3) + 4 = 1 (planar)

----

Example 2.4 (Figure 2.5a) 

Let's calculate DOFs for:
1. K-link planar serial chain robot
2. 5-Bar planara linkage (closed loop)
3. Stephenson 6-bar linkage
4. Watt 6-bar linkage

----

Example 2.4 (Figure 2.5a to d)

These are some classic planar mechanisms for robots

Let's calculate DOFs for:
1. K-link planar serial chain robot
2. 5-Bar planara linkage (closed loop)
3. Stephenson 6-bar linkage
4. Watt 6-bar linkage

1. For K-link (all revolute joints):
DOF =  m(N-1-J) + Sigma(Fi)
    =  3(K+1 - 1 - K) + K
    =  3.0 + K 
    = K
So every K-link planar serial chain (open at one end) will have DOF = K
(this is also called a kR robot)

2. For 5-bar linkage (Figure 2.5b):

DOF =  m(N-1-J) + Sigma(Fi)
       (N = 5 i.e. 4 links + ground, J = revolute joints = 5)
    =  3(5-1-5) + 5
    =  -3 + 5
    =  2

(note that between kR-Robot (kLinks - open) and (b) 5-bar linkage, the difference is the open arm)

3. Stephenson 6-bar linkage

N = 5 + 1
J = 7 (note that the main body's "single circle" markings are also revolute joints)

DOF = m(N-1-J) + sigma(Fi)
    = 3(6 - 1 -7) + 7
    = 3(-2) + 7
    = -6 + 7
    = 1

4. Watt 6-bar linkage

N = 5 + 1
J = 7

DOF = m(N-1-J) + Sigma(Fi)
    = 3(6-1-7) + 7
    = -6 + 7
    = 1

----

Example 2.5 (Figure 2.6)

This is an example of a planar mechanism with 2 overlapping joints now
Note that in Figure 2.6, the right side bottom diagonal open-on-top rectangle
is to be interpretted as 3 links touching that part. Since 1 joint only connects
2 links, that open diagonal rect could therefore be 2 joints.

DOF = m(N-1-J) + Sigma(Fi)
N = 5 + 3(the open rect) + 1(ground)
J = 6(regular) + 2 (revolute - the overlap) + 1 prismatic = 9

DOF = 3(8 - 1 - 9) + 9
    = 3(-2) + 9
    = -6 + 9
    = 3

Example 2.7 - Delta Robot - Figure 2.8

The delta robot is basically 2 structures connected with 3 legs.
The top structure is stationary and the lower is mobile.
The legs contain 3 revolute, 4 spherical joints, and 5 links each (clearly shown in Fig 28)
The 2 platforms can be considered 2 links each. (Not accounting for end effector fingers etc, only this part)

So:  J = (3 + 4) * 3 = 21
and: N = 5 * 3 + 2   = 17

Recall that Fi(revolute)=1 and Fi(Spherical)=3 (for m=6 or 3D/spacial)

Thus DOF = 6(17 - 1 - 21) + (3*3)*1 + (4*3)*3
         = 6(-5) + 9 + 36
         = -30 + 45
         = 15

So a delta Robot actually has 15 DOF. 

But the actual end effector only shows 3 DOF in practice. This is because the parallelogram legs (each leg
having 4 links) ensures that the moving lower half is always parallel to the top fixed structure. This "tortion"
of the 4 links in every parallelogram ( and 3 of these legs ) introduces hidden constraints of 12, and 15-12 = 3.

Finally the delta robot through its end effector acts as an x-y-z cartesian positioning device.

Example: Calculate DOF of the human arm, assuming the palm/fingers are a blackbox. Thus consider joints with shoulder, elbow and wrist and assume shoulder is earthed.

Ans: So 3 links (+ 1 earth) implies N = 4. J = 3. The joints (I assume) are shoulder = Spherical, elbow = Spherical and Wrist = revolute
DOF = 6 * (4 - 1 - 3) + 3 + 3 + 1
    = 0 + 7
    = 7

Example 2.8 - Stewart-Gough platform 

This is in figure 1.1b. (page 42 to 22).

2 platforms (from the pg 22 diagram). Lower looks fixed and upper is movable(mobile).
6 legs between the 2 platforms but each has 2 transitional inner legs, so 12 links + the 2 top and bottom.
So N = 12 + 2 = 14

legs = looks like 2 revolute joints each, so 12, and 1 prismatic each, so 6, hence 18
the top platform places constraints on the motion, but intuitively its not clear.

actually joints in each leg: the 2 revolutes are actually 1 universal and 1 spherical.
So J : 3 joints for each leg and 6 legs so, J = 18 (6 universal, 6 spherical, 6 prismatic)

DOF = m(N - 1 - J) + Sigma(Fi)
    = 6(14 - 1 - 18) + 6(1) + 6(2) + 6(3)
    = -30 + 36
    = 6

(note that some versions of Steward Gough have the 6 universal joints replaced with 6 spherical)
that would make it : -30 + 6(1) + 6(2) + 6(2) = -30 + 30 = 0, but the spherical joint allows torsional
rotations about the leg axis (but this does not overall affect the motion of the mobile platform)

Steve-Gough platform is used in car and airplane cockpit simulators, as the platform moves with full
6 DOF. Each leg can share load but the structure is obviously less restrictive than open chain.
