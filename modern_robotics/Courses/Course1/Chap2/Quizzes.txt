Quiz1:

1. Consider a joint between two rigid bodies. Each rigid body has m degrees of freedom (m=3 for a planar rigid body and m=6 for a spatial rigid body) in the absence of any constraints. The joint has f degrees of freedom (e.g., f=1 for a revolute joint or f=3 for a spherical joint). 

How many constraints does the joint place on the motion of one rigid body relative to the other?  Write your answer as a mathematical expression in terms of m and f.

A: (m - f) are the constraints.

2. Consider a mechanism consisting of three spatial rigid bodies (including ground, N=4) and four joints: one revolute, one prismatic, one universal, and one spherical. According to Grubler's formula, how many degrees of freedom does the mechanism have?

A: DOF = 6 * (4 - 1 - 4) + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3
       = -6 + 7
       = 1

3. A mechanism that is incapable of motion has zero degrees of freedom. In some circumstances, Grubler's formula indicates that the number of degrees of freedom of a mechanism is negative. How should that result be interpreted?a

A: The constraints implied by the joints must not be independent.
