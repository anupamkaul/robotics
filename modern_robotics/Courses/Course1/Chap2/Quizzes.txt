Quiz1:

1. Consider a joint between two rigid bodies. Each rigid body has m degrees of freedom (m=3 for a planar rigid body and m=6 for a spatial rigid body) in the absence of any constraints. The joint has f degrees of freedom (e.g., f=1 for a revolute joint or f=3 for a spherical joint). 

How many constraints does the joint place on the motion of one rigid body relative to the other?  Write your answer as a mathematical expression in terms of m and f.

A: (m - f) are the constraints.

2. Consider a mechanism consisting of three spatial rigid bodies (including ground, N=4) and four joints: one revolute, one prismatic, one universal, and one spherical. According to Grubler's formula, how many degrees of freedom does the mechanism have?

A: DOF = 6 * (4 - 1 - 4) + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3
       = -6 + 7
       = 1

3. A mechanism that is incapable of motion has zero degrees of freedom. In some circumstances, Grubler's formula indicates that the number of degrees of freedom of a mechanism is negative. How should that result be interpreted?a

A: The constraints implied by the joints must not be independent.

1. Using the methods for determining the number of degrees of freedom of a rigid body in 3-dim space from the book and video, find the number of degrees of
freedom of a rigid body in a conceptual 4-dimensional space. Answer should be an integer.

A: 10  (4 + 3 + 2 + 1)

2. From q-1, indicate how many of the degrees of freedom are angular (rotational). Answer should be an integer.

A: 6   (all except the first 4)

(see DOF_N_Dim.txt for my general theory about DOFs of a link in Nth dimension)

3. Assuming your arm has 7 dof and you're a waiter that has to carry a tray without spilling (horizontal). How many dofs?

A: I just cal the constraints and minus from 7. Palm's shouldn't go up-down (that angle) and side-ways (that angle).
(X-angle rotation is not OK (i.e. the up-down) and Z-angle rotation is not ok (the side-swerve). Technically the "base-swerve" is ok (The Y-angle rotation)

So 7 - 2 = 5
